# Iot_waterlevel_measurement_with_database_integration(Firebase_Realtime_Database)
This is a water level measurement's tool integrated with IOT Systems. I use ultrasonic sensors to measure the value of water level. 
Then the measurement data will be saved to the database. For the database I use Firebase Realtime Database.
I also sync my device time via internet to ntp server. 

for the client side, I created an android application with Kodular's Platform to display measurement data in realtime. and also historical data so client can search data by date. 

note: * Kodular is a platform to make android application using block programming
      * To open the (MonitoringElevasiPLTABatangAgam_copy.aia)'s file you need to open kodular in your browser first, then import it. 
      * NTP Server is a Server for sync time
