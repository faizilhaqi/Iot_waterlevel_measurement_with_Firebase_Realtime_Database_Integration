# Iot_waterlevel
This is a water level measurement's tool integrated with IOT Systems. I use ultrasonic sensors to measure the value of water level. 
Then the measurement data will be saved to the database. For the database I use Firebase Realtime Database.
I also sync my device time via internet to ntp server. 

for the client side, I created an android application to display measurement data in realtime. and also I added a feature so that the client can search data by date.
